I am an Assistant Professor in [the Linguistics department at University of Utah](https://linguistics.ucla.edu/), speacializing in computational phonology. I received my PhD in [Linguistics from UCLA](https://linguistics.ucla.edu/), under the supervision of [Tim Hunter](https://timhunter.humspace.ucla.edu/) and [Bruce Hayes](https://linguistics.ucla.edu/people/hayes/). My [research]({{ site.url }}/research/) focuses on how the structural properties of natural languages, especially (morpho)phonology, are represented, computed and learned. To address these questions, I seek converging evidence from different methodologies, including traditional/formal linguistic analyses, mathematical investigations, computational modeling, and experimental studies. My [dissertation](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/0cx5g7zq#main) studied the learning and computational properties of morphophonological copying (i.e. reduplication).
