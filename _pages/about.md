I am a 5th-year PhD candidate at the [UCLA Linguistics Department](https://linguistics.ucla.edu/). I am broadly interested in how structural properties of natural languages, especially (morpho-)phonology, are represented, computed and learned. I hope to better understand these questions through different methodologies, including mathematical analyses, computational modeling, and experimental studies. 

In my dissertation, I study various aspects of the copying operation in human languages, focusing on reduplication in the phonology and morphology interface. I am advised by [Tim Hunter](https://timhunter.humspace.ucla.edu/) and [Bruce Hayes](https://linguistics.ucla.edu/people/hayes/). My committee members are [Claire Moore-Cantwell](http://www.clairemoorecantwell.org/), [Kie Zuraw](https://linguistics.ucla.edu/people/zuraw/), and [Colin Wilson](https://colincwilson.github.io/). I also work with [Megha Sundara](https://linguistics.ucla.edu/person/megha-sundara/) and I am a member of the [UCLA Language Lab](https://languagelab.humanities.ucla.edu/en/).
